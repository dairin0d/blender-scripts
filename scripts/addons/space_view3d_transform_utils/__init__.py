PROBLEMS:
* the way I work with axis-angle rotation mode seems buggy
* bug/glitch with VIEW system, noticeable when chosed as a manipulator orientation (view matrix (or other params) lag one frame behind, which leads to visible distortions of the manipulator when rotating the view)
* moth3r says Batch Transforms is slow on files with many objects

\\ Another possible option on how to handle the "hide 3D cursor" problem:
Since the main devs refuse to add an option to not draw cursor (or even alter its appearance), the only _other_ way to "hide" it is to either move it outside of camera view for the duration of the 2D rendering, or to over-paint it with the result of 3D rendering (which will over-paint other 2D rendering too).
The "out-of-camera-view" solution has 2 drawbacks:
* minor: other addons may potentially use cursor position to draw something
* major: cursor movement causes a redraw event
In fact, two generic solutions can be proposed for each problem, which would also be useful for other kinds of situations:
* provide a way to manipulate the order of 2D/3D drawing callbacks
* provide a way to disable the redraw event for a section of code
** useful for anything that requires making modifications to the scene and then reverts to the original state

BUG: if editmode object is not the same as active object, selection-walker's bmesh is None

\\ vmath / gmath for various vector/geometric utilities?

Fix MeshCache/bounding_box according to MeshBaker logic

moth3r asks to not post on forum until he makes a video

[DONE] Shift+Click on pos/rot/scale buttons in Coordsystem -> pick all aspects from active object/bone

Copy/Paste coordinates:
    * customizable decimal and axis separators for coordinate copy-pasting (e.g. dot/comma, comma/semicolon/space/tab/newline)
    * Summary extras: per-vector copy/paste (respecting uniformity locks) (option: using units or the raw values ?)
    * Vector extras: swizzle? (evaluate as python expression? e.g. w,x,y,z -> -w,0.5*z,y,2*x) (option: apply to summary or to each individual object)
    * Vector extras: per-summary copy/paste (respecting uniformity locks) (option: using units or the raw values ?)
        * \\ cursor/bookmark/etc. to active/min/max/center/mean/median? (redundant: can be achieved via copy-pasting, given that coordinate system is the same)

"Particle Ensemble transformation"? (representing each individual vertex as a particle object with full matrix might be not very efficient)

For EDIT_ARMATURE mode: implement aggregation of other settings from EditBone?
    use_deform
    use_envelope_multiply
    bbone_segments
    bbone_in
    bbone_out

* sync coordsystems/summaries/etc. between 3D views
* Pick transform? (respecting axis locks)
* Grase pencil summaries?

fusion 360 has a lot of cool features (moth3r says it's the most user-friendly CAD)
